# sigDriver
sigDriver is a driver discovery tool base on mutational signature exposures. Currently,  single base substitution signatures are supported.

# Prerequisites
`sigDriver` works in R (>= 3.4.0) and depends on the following packages: data.table, optparse, dplyr, GenomicRanges, reshape2, SKAT, matrixStats, rtracklayer, trackViewer, qqman, VariantAnnotation


# System Requirements
## Hardware requirements
`sigDriver` package can run on a standard computer. The memory requirment is dependent on the number of the input somatic variants and number of requested threads.

The runtimes below are generated using a computer with 16 GB RAM, 4 cores@2.3 GHz.


## Software requirements
### OS Requirements
This package is supported for *macOS* and *Linux*. The package has been tested on the following systems:
+ Linux: openSUSE 42.3


# Installation
Installation in R using devtools:
+ This should take less than 1 minute if all prerequisites were meet
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("wkljohn/sigDriver",subdir="R_library")
```

Installing helper Rscripts and the example data: 
```console
git clone https://github.com/wkljohn/sigDriver.git
```

# How to use
Run sigDriver
+ The approximate run time for this part of the demo is XX seconds
```console
Rscript run_sigdriver.R -s SBS9 -t 4 -v ./example/example_SBS9.snv.simple.gz -e ./example/example_signatures.tsv -m ./example/example_SBS9_metadata.tsv -o ./output/
```

Run results annotation
+ The approximate run time for this part of the demo is XX seconds
```console
Rscript run_sigdriver_annotate.R -g gencode.v19.gtf -t 4 -l ./output/SBS9_results.tsv -s SBS9 -v ./example/example_SBS9.snv.simple.gz -e ./example/example_signatures.tsv -m ./example/example_SBS9_metadata.tsv -o ./output/
```

# Results
+ Running `run_sigdriver.R` produce the following outputs:

| File name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{signature}_results.tsv` | the final output of the script on associated hotspots and the details |
| `{signature}_results_FULL.tsv` | the hotspots output before filtering and p-values correction
| `{signature}_qq.png` | the quantile-quantile plot for the distribution of p-values


+ Running `run_sigdriver_annotate.R` produce the following outputs:

| File name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{signature}_perturb_sites_annotated_results.tsv` | the perturbed p-values and gene annotations of each hotspot point mutation |
| `./plots/{signature}/[hotspot].png` | the graphical presentation of the significant hotspot |
| `./plots/{signature}/[hotspot].png` | the graphical presentation of the significant hotspot |
